# My Self-Care / Productivity Routine

# My Self-Care / Productivity Routine “Living Document”This is a blog post about the routine I’m using to improve my self-care and productivity. This blog post is intended to be a “living document”, meaning I’ll update it as my routine changes over time.

The very short story is that my current routine involves a lot of software for tracking and notes, intermittent fasting, dividing the day into deep work and non-deep work portions, and Pomodoro time tracking, and prioritizing self-care like sleep hygiene. 

The topic of self-care and productivity is highly individualized . What works well for one person might be the totally wrong system for another. What works great for you today, might be the wrong system for you in a few years, which is part of the reason I’m calling this a “living document”, so I can change it.

By reading about how lots of other people optimize their routines, we can get inspired and learn some new ideas and tricks. I hope by writing this, others can learn some productivity ideas and tricks from me and improve their own life. 

By “productivity”, I don’t just mean work. If you want to spend more time with your kids, that’s productive. 

The system I’m describing here is something I’ve designed and iterated over a few years, influenced by many different sources. *Getting Things Done* and *The Andrew Huberman* podcast will stick out especially, but I’ll discuss some more that I can remember in a bit.

My system may sound a little intense and overwhelming but in practice it’s very flexible. I might also sound like I have a very rigid life, but in fact, I’m often impulsive and do what I feel like in the moment, particularly after the morning fast is over. 

Days off the system are also fine. As a teenager I worked on a garbage truck, we were short on people and I didn’t mind the extra hours so I told my boss, a very old man, I could work all 7 nexts the next week. His response stuck with me, 

*“Even God took a day off, and you’re not God.”*

I’m not religious, but the point was made. I like keeping the self-care habits 7 days a week and I’ll only do total breaks from the system on vacations. I’ll circle back on these topics in more depth but first, let’s do a high level overview.

### The tl;dr

This post might get a bit long so I want to jump into the action right in the beginning, then circle back to all my reasonings and motivations. I use a few software tools but the “big four” are :

1. My own habit/goal tracker called Navigoals (for tracking pretty much everything)
2. Notion (for daily TODOs and lots of notes)
3. Trello (for capturing quick inbound items and as global TODO )
4. Google Calendar 

I use a few other software tools as well. I use a note taking app called Bear for my Apple Watch as well as Apple Reminders, though I will likely replace both as I add similar features directly to Navigoals. I use MyFitnessPal for food tracking (and I’ve experimented with Noom). 

The basic daily routine is this:

- Wake up as early as you can while still making sure you’re getting enough sleep. Ideally go to bed the same time every day and wake up the same time.

## Circling Back

By productivity, I don’t necessarily mean “rise and grind” culture, overworking, and burnout. I mostly mean getting done what you want to get done. Maybe you want to spend more time with your kids, in which case I would define spending time with your kids as productive. Maybe you really want to learn how to play the piano, in which case I would define practicing the piano as productive.

I do think setting positive goals and pursuing progress towards them can often make us happier. I recently learned the word  eudaimonistic pleasure, which is contrast to hedonistic pleasure. 

Hedonistic pleasure is when you get pleasure from the obvious stuff - food, alcohol, sex, drugs, and rock & roll.  

Eudamonistic pleasure is the pleasure you get from achieving your goals, like studying really hard all semester and being proud that you aced the class.

One of my friends who is an avid rock climber and mountaineer has described a similar same concept as type 1 and type 2 fun. Type 1 fun is stuff that’s obviously fun like a music festival, type 2 fun is running a marathon - difficult and uncomfortable while you’re doing it but you might get “runner’s high” and pride for having finished it.

While most of us are more actively tempted by hedonism (type 1 fun)
