# Professional

Hi, my name is Bill, and I'm a Software Engineer living in San Francisco.

I work at Pinterest, focusing on Python infrastructure, tooling, and developer experience.

Previously, I worked at many startups including Bastille, Thumbtack, and Knewton. My longest tenure was at Google as both
a Developer Programs Engineer for Google Cloud and a
Software Engineer on the Mobile Productivity team focused 
on data analytics of internal mobile developers.

# Personal

My legal first name is William and middle name is Arthur which is why I use
'waprin' as my online identifier in some places.

I live in San Francisco with my wife, daughter, two sphynx cats,
and bernedoodle.

Sometimes you might run into me surfing at Pacifica or Santa Cruz or snowboarding in Tahoe.
