# Professional

Hi, my name is Bill, and I'm a Software Engineer living in San Francisco.

I currently work at Pinterest, focusing on Python infrastructure,
tooling, and developer experience.

Previously, I worked at many startups including Bastille, Thumbtack, and Knewton. My longest tenure was at Google as both
a Developer Programs Engineer for Google Cloud and a
Software Engineer on the Mobile Productivity team focused 
on data analytics of internal mobile developers.

While I've mostly done backend engineering, infrastructure, and
operations professionally, I consider myself decent at frontend development. I also have non-trivial machine learning
experience, mostly just implementing off-the-shelf algorithms.

Like many engineers, I get easily distracted by new, shiny
things. These days, I'm heavily inspired by IndieHackers
and working on a small project I will release soon. I am
also excited about blockchain and hoping to learn more about
it in the years to come, especially Ethereum and Solana.

# Personal

My legal first name is William, which is why some of my online aliases start with the letter 'w'.

I live in San Francisco with my wife, daughter, two sphynx cats,
and bernedoodle.

Sometimes you might run into me surfing at Pacifica or Santa Cruz or snowboarding in Tahoe.

I also have a SoundCloud where I produce silly electronic
music every now and then. I used to link it from this site,
but I've decided that my music is bad enough that if you want
to hear it, you'll have to ask.
