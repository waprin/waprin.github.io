## Contact

The easiest way to contact me is via email. My personal email is waprin at google's public email provider. Hopefully you're smart enough to put that together. You can also try 
mentioning me on Twitter.

I will reply to almost every email _unless_ it looks like it was generated by automated recruiting software. 

## Current projects 


Currently, I'm focused on building an advanced goal tracking app called [Navigoals](https://www.navigoals.com). It still a work in progress - so be forgiving! 

I also have a few "micro-SaaS"  products queued up in the spirit of ["small bets"](https://billprin.com/2022/10/23/small-bets.html) - stay tuned! 

You can read more about this on the [projects page](/projects)


## Past professional experience

Most of my professional work was doing backend development, infrastructure, or data engineering work, mostly in C++, Java, and Python. [My side projects have tended towards the frontend though](https://billprin.com/2022/10/17/stop-worrying-love-frontend.html), and these days I'm focusing more on frontend to launch various micro-SaaS ideas.  So I'm currently mostly focused on Typescript and Swift for web and iOS respectively. 

Most recently, I worked at Pinterest in their Engineering Productivity division in Infrastructure focused on Python language concerns around developer productivity, security, and container
runtimes.

Previously, I worked at many startups including Bastille, Thumbtack, and Knewton. 

My longest tenure was at Google as both
a Developer Programs Engineer for Google Cloud, focused on the Python developer experience for GCP, and a
Software Engineer on the Mobile Productivity team focused  on data analytics of internal mobile developers.

# Personal

My legal first name is William and middle name is Arthur which is why I use
'waprin' as my online identifier in some places.

I live in San Francisco with my wife, daughter, two sphynx cats,
and bernedoodle.

Sometimes you might run into me surfing at Pacifica or Santa Cruz or snowboarding in Tahoe.
