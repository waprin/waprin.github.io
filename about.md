# Professional

Hi, my name is Bill, and I'm an engineer, writer, and entrepeneur living in San Francisco.

Currently, I'm focused on building a goal tracking app called Navigoals ( navigoals.com ). It still a work in progress
and requires a direct invite - let me know if you're interested!

Most recently, I worked at Pinterest in their Engineering Productivity division in Infrastructure focused on Python language concerns.
Previously, I worked at many startups including Bastille, Thumbtack, and Knewton. My longest tenure was at Google as both
a Developer Programs Engineer for Google Cloud and a
Software Engineer on the Mobile Productivity team focused  on data analytics of internal mobile developers.

# Personal

My legal first name is William and middle name is Arthur which is why I use
'waprin' as my online identifier in some places.

I live in San Francisco with my wife, daughter, two sphynx cats,
and bernedoodle.

Sometimes you might run into me surfing at Pacifica or Santa Cruz or snowboarding in Tahoe.
