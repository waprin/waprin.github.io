One of my big inspirations for trying to blog in the first place is this post by Nathan Marz, creator of Apache Storm, where he argues that [you should blog even if you have no readers](http://nathanmarz.com/blog/you-should-blog-even-if-you-have-no-readers.html). I find his arguments on the value of writing for it's own sake to be really convincing, besides the obvious value if your blog does in fact develop a readership. 

Recently, I've decided to make another attempt to revamp this blog, including of course, a rename and a refactor. One decision I pondered whether I should just try to start from scratch all together. It feels somewhat embarassing when you have only a few posts per year. 

However, I've realized there was huge value in starting my blog a year ago, even if I've been really undisciiplined in updating it. The biggest value add is that once you've done all the upfront work, adding more posts is a lot less effort. Sure, if you just spin up a default WordPress theme, you can have that in the first place, but I don't think I'm alone in that I wanted a blog that felt a little more personal. So now, when I do feel like writing, that personalization has already been started. I already have a tool picked out, in this case Jekyll and Github Pages, even if like every technology decision I make, I waffle on whether it's the one I really want. I already have a theme picked out (ditto). I alread figured out how to setup Disqus and share links.

Finally, I already know what it feels like to write a post and get it published, both casual one like this one and technical ones. 

As for being embarassed, I realized this is a really stupid perspective. Even if someone look at your blog and sees you only wrote a few times a year, they'll know exactly what happened. You got busy! It's the same reason most people don't write *any* blog posts at all. So, I don't think you can be judged too harshly for not writing enough...except by yourself of course :-)
