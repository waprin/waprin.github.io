When I first saw BackboneJS, it all seemed far too abstract for what I was trying to do. I was making a few AJAX calls and updating DOM elements - why do I need an entire MVC framework?

If you are making a few or no AJAX calls in your application and handling few user events, then a little jQuery in a script file is probably all you need. But as modern standards demands interactive, real-time applications, your logic can often times grow somewhat complex. 

The primary purpose of BackboneJS, a relatively small library, is not to add functionality to your code but rather to add organization. It helps separate the code that handles your data from the code that manipulates DOM elements. It also does provide a ton of utility functionality, along with its helper UnderscoreJS. This organization is sorely missingle from pages that try to do too much with just jQuery.

To illustrate this, I want to start with some page logic that I wrote with just a jQuery AJAX request
