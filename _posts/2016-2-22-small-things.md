When searching for a new job, there are a lot of small indicators about whether a job will a good place to work as an engineer. I've found 'vanity perks' like ping-pong tables or team outings to be a poor indicator, as well as companies that let you keep 'up-to-date' by embracing the latest-and-greatest stack. On the other hand, here are some less talked about indicators of a great job.

# The CEO has an engineering (or design) background

Some might think that the CEO of the company doesn't have much impact on your job. After all, you might never even get a chance to meet him, and you certainly won't see him very much in your day-to-day job, unless you work at a very small company. Despite that, I still think the CEO will have a huge impact on your work, because ultimately he is the one definining the company and the company culture stems from him.

This is why I think a great indicator that a company is a good place to work is a *CEO with an engineering background*. If not an engineering background, the closer the better, such as design or product. The farthest you can get away from engineering is probabaly sales

Many might scoff at me, and suggest that I'm simply being an engineering elitist because I'm an engineer. To some extent, of course I am, and I admit there are many successful companies with many happy employees led by people of diverse backgrounds, but especially from business, finance, and sales. 

But look around at the top tech companies known for being great places to work and for creating world-class products. The first name someone might mention is Google, Facebook, or Twitter - all (currently) led by CEOs who helped code the original project. Amazon is known for having a "non-techincal" CEO by Valley standards, even though Jeff Bezos has a Master's in Computer Science by the #1 university in the USA 

I think there are two factors to why a technical degree is a good indicator of a good company to work for. The first is that in terms of career advancement, people like people like themselves. They will promote them and create a culture where people similar to themselves will thrive and grow. How can they not? It's what they know and understand best, so to some extent it makes sense.

The second factor is that as an engineer, you want to work on great products. You definitely don't want to work on mediocre products that succeed because they were marketed or sold well. However, many companies can succeed doing exactly that, and it should come as no surprise that those types of companies tend to be led by salesman and marketers. The CEO drives the focus of the company, and that focus to match your own.

Incidentally, I have noticed that there are many successful sales and marketing driven companies, even beating companies with superior products. Yet the enormous winners at global scale tend to the ones with the best products. This is why the bohemoths of tech have emerged from the more product/engineering focus West Coast companies vs. New York companies that tend to be driven by sales and marketing types.

# A focus on the user/customer

The best companies don't put an engineer, or a salesman, or a businessman on top - everyone in the company is below the customer. While this might sound like something every startup would claim, you can quickly deduce whether these claims are lip service or a serious commitment just by the type of things people are talking about. Are they geeking out over the latest database, or talking about how that database will directly solve a customer's problem? Are they excited about the new office in Brazil because it's a growing economy and they get to take business trips to Rio, or because they know how badly Brazilians want to use your product and what problems it will solve for them?

A lot of people get hung up on whether a company is making a crazy amount of profit today, but lots of companies persist despite that as long as they're making someone happy. Of course, here I'm echoing [many of Paul Graham's essays](http://paulgraham.com/good.html).

Even if you're not directly in the target audience, the value of what you're working on should be obvious. If you don't feel like you're creating much value, you probably aren't, so those jobs are going to have a low ceiling on both personal satifaction and compepnsation.

# A job that respects you

Maybe the biggest mistake you can make is to work for a job that doesn't respect you. Usually, the signs of this are early when talking to a company, but they're not always easiest to spot.

One of the easiest ways to spot a company doesn't respect you is that they are dishonest or misleading about compensation. For example, they offer you an equity grant but won't tell you the number of outstanding shares. Or they get too offended when you negotiate. Despite some advice I've seen online, I think that sometimes if you try to negotiate a job offer, you *will* lose it. Often, it hurts the ego of whoever the employer is, or they think you're too mercantile or too difficult to handle.

But really, do you want to be working for these types of companies? As an employer, I'd want smart employees, and smart employees negotiate. Why would I want to hire someone so stupid he didn't negotiate his job offer? Yet some employers would prefer subordinate serfs to top talent, even if it just comes down to a difference in salary that's less than what the company just spent on chairs is.

There are some other small signs. While I'm not against fun startup perks, you should be concerned if they are giving the engineers nerf guns but not business development. It hints of a culture divide where the engineers are placated but not taken seriously. Similarly with dress code, if upper management is wearing jeans, then you absolutely can to, but if they let engineers wear jeans while the "adults" wear suits, that's indicative of a bridge in professional status that you don't want to have to withstand. Avoid.

# Closing

There are a lot of things to look for in a potential job, so no definitve list can encompass all the things you might need to consider. But if there's one takeway from this post, it's that things like professional status in the workplace matter, and will impact your opportunity for career growth and impact. So make sure you pick employers by considering how important they consider you, how much they respect you, and how much impact you think you will actually have on the world working there.
