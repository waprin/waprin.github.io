>if it doesn’t come bursting out of you
in spite of everything,
don’t do it.
unless it comes unasked out of your
heart and your mind and your mouth
and your gut,
don’t do it.
if you have to sit for hours
staring at your computer screen
or hunched over your
typewriter
searching for words,
don’t do it.

## Pre-Ramble

Bukowsi's advice on [when to write](http://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/so-you-want-be-writer)
contrasts sharply with Jeff Atwood's of Coding Horror's advice to 
 [stick to a weekly schedule](http://blog.codinghorror.com/how-to-achieve-ultimate-blog-success-in-one-easy-step/)
. Clearly, I'm on Bukowski's side of this disagreement. Appending a "(Part 1)"
 to the title of my first and only blog post was inserted
 to hopefully motivate me to finish the second part, but instead it's just 
 going to dangle [Mel Brooks' style](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082517/).


I was pretty amused to read Kris Horowitz's Medium post, [From Zero to Developer… Kind of](https://medium.com/in-beta/learning-to-code-ab596fd1c412)
, when I read this paragraph

>I tried to maintain a blog with my friend Maya chronicling our progress but 
it was hard for me to keep up because I felt like I didn’t know enough to share something with anyone. What did I know? Why listen to me?

Kris had only recently graduated from a developer bootcamp when she wrote 
that, and I'm not sure if she's aware of this or not, but that feeling never 
seems to 
go away. I've been trying to program since I was making beautiful music 
with QBasic's BEEP command, and I *still* feel like I don't know enough to 
share with other people. 

I actually have several drafts for Part 2  on how to write unit test for 
your Coffeescript 
code, but I kept get deeper and deeper into rabbit holes. I knew I wanted to
 use [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.12/index.html) , and since a 
 huge point of the testing was to get more modular code, there was no point 
 unless you used [require.js](http://requirejs.org/). Of course, a vanilla 
 requirejs setup has too much overhead for a production app, so then I 
 discovered I really wanted [almond](https://github.com/jrburke/almond) to 
 optimize it. Of course I needed a [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) task to run 
 this optimization only 
for production builds. This ended up being a ton of boilerplate, so I needed 
 to learn 
  [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) to generate the correct setup. And on and on...
  
In any case, it never got finished, and this blog started to look like one of
 those sad graveyards where you suspect the 
 writer was relieved to have to stop pretending to want to blog as soon as a 
 full-time job offer showed up. 
 Not only that, but I ended up moving to
  California for a new job which immediately made the blog name 
  nonsensical. 
  But I'm going to do my best to resume writing here, because the platform 
  options for writers who want to combine the topics of software testing best
   practices with
  alcoholic 20th-century American writers 
  is pretty limited. And even if I ended up on the 
  West Coast, I think I'll always have some New York in me. So while for now 
  I'll have to substitute my Big Apple with a kale smoothie - Gotham Coder 
  is back.
