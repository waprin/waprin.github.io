Hi, my name is Bill, and I'm a software engineer living in San Francisco. 

I'm also an aspiring product designer, product manager, writer, and entrepeneur - all wrapped up as an indie hacker.

I write posts on programming, mental health, and startups on my [blog](/blog).

Currently, I'm focused on building an advanced goal tracking app called [Navigoals](https://www.navigoals.com). It's still a work in progress - so be forgiving! 

This is a special project to me because of how importantly I value mental health. You can read more about my motivations in [this post](https://billprin.com/2022/10/14/why-im-building-navi.html).

I'm also blogging and exploring other ["small bets"](https://billprin.com/2022/10/23/small-bets.html) to diversify how I spend my time and potential sources of revenue.

I have several "micro-saas" ideas queued up. Many of which will be built in public -  so stay tuned, and if you're interested, you can find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/bill_prin).

You can learn more about me, my professional background, and some personal details on the [about page](/about).
