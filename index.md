Hi, my name is Bill, and I'm a software engineer living in San Francisco. 

I'm also an aspiring product designer, product manager, writer, and entrepeneur - all wrapped up as an indie hacker.

I write posts on programming, mental health, and startups on my [blog](/blog).

My biggest passion project is a new type of goal and habit tracker called Navigoals.
It's still an early work in progress, but you can sign up on the email list if you're interested - [Navigoals.com](https://navigoals.com).

I have several "micro-saas" ideas queued up. Many of which will be built in public -  so stay tuned, and if you're interested, you can find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/bill_prin).

You can learn more about me, my professional background, and some personal details on the [about page](/about).
